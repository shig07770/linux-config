# `shig07770/linux-config`
Dotfiles and scripts to quickly get started with a new Linux computer.

> If you want to use these dotfiles/scripts, you should probably fork the repository, review the code and files and change them according to your needs. Use at your own risk.

First, begin by downloading the repository's `.zip` by clicking [here](https://codeload.github.com/shig07770/linux-config/zip/refs/heads/master) and unzip it.

Each OS has its own folder and each OS version has its own configuration script.

By default, running a configuration script will do a **full** installation which is (likely) not what you want. You can open the file and choose between a few presets or make your own.

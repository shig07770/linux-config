# `shig07770/linux-config`
Dotfiles and scripts to quickly get started with a new Linux computer.

> If you want to use these dotfiles/scripts, you should probably fork the repository, review the code and files and change them according to your needs. Use at your own risk.

First, begin by downloading the repository's `.zip` by clicking [here](https://codeload.github.com/shig07770/linux-config/zip/refs/heads/master) and unzip it.

Dotfiles are in the `dotfile` directory.

Installation scripts can be found in the `presets` directory for a set OS (ie, `debian/bookworm/presets` contains installation scripts for Debian 12). These scripts install and set up mutliple softwares along with the dotfiles.

Smaller scripts that usually install only one thing can be found in the other directories (ie, `dev`, `game` or `util`).
